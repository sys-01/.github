# SYS-01 — Personal Command System

SYS-01 is a personal dashboard and command center designed to centralize the monitoring, tracking, and management of personal systems such as finances, markets, accounts, and tasks.  
It provides a modular, extensible, and long-term foundation to pilot everything from investments to daily workflows.

## About

SYS-01 aims to be a **personal command system** — a single cockpit to observe, analyze, and control your data and decisions.

The project is built with the following principles in mind:

- **Modular** — multiple systems (finance, markets, tasks, etc.) managed in one place
- **Extensible** — new modules can be added over time without breaking the core
- **Structured** — clear separation between backend logic and frontend UI
- **Local-first** — designed to run locally, with potential future evolutions
- **Long-term** — focused on maintainability and clean architecture
